# Electrocardiogram-QRS-complex-Detector
An algorithm for detecting the QRS wave in electrocardiogram signals
A series of  mathematical calculations are performed on a sample electrocardiogram signal to minimize the noise and distinguish the QRS complex from other high frequency noises in ECG signal.
